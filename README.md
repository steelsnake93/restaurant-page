# Restaurant Page Project

## Overview
 The aim of this project is to create a simple restaurant homepage using JavaScript DOM manipulation. The page should consist of an image, headline, and copy about the restaurant, as well as tabs for Contact and Menu pages. The project should start with npm init to generate a package.json file, followed by the installation of webpack using npm install. The project directory should include a src directory for the index.js file, a dist directory for the index.html file, and a webpack.config.js file. The HTML skeleton should be set up with a single div element with an id of "content".

 ## Steps

1. Start the project with npm init to generate a package.json file.
2. Install webpack with npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev.
3. Set up the project directory with src and dist directories, an index.js file in src, an index.html file in dist, and a webpack.config.js file.
4. Set up an HTML skeleton with a single div element with an id of "content".
5. Write a simple console.log or alert statement in src/index.js and run npx webpack.
6. Load dist/index.html in a browser to make sure everything is working correctly.
7. Hard-code the restaurant's image, headline, and copy into the HTML for now to see how they look on the page.
8. Remove the image, headline, and copy from the HTML and create them using JavaScript only by appending them to div#content.
9. Set up tabbed browsing for the Contact and Menu pages.
10. Write tab-switching logic inside index.js with event listeners for each tab.
11. If hosting on GitHub Pages, move the index.html file to the root directory and follow the instructions on this gist.

## Final Product
 The final product should be a fully functional restaurant homepage with tabbed browsing for the Contact and Menu pages, generated entirely using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
